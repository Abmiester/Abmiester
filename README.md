## Hi there, visitor 👋

- :telescope: Previously, I did applied machine learning oriented research and development at a [young and growing startup](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gridwise) working on solving gig economy problems. Read more about the platforms we were building [here](https://medium.com/gridwise-analytics) and [here](https://gridwise.io/features).
- :boom: Prior to that I did similar work at a [flourishing startup](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bellhops) in the moving industry. You can read about some of that [here](https://medium.com/bellhops-moving/machines-can-now-tell-you-how-long-your-move-will-take-part-1-of-4-c98ad545488d).
- :zap: In graduate school, my research group and I studied and developed robust predictive modeling and applied machine learning techniques for financial markets. To get an overview of the work, I recommend reading the published paper [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417417301331?via%3Dihub).
- :robot: In college, I competed in robotics events and a racecar design and development competition, and dabbled in design, testing, and fabrication of circuit boards. My undergraduate thesis was on pattern acknowledgement and communication between robots.
