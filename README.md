### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently doing applied machine learning oriented research and development at a young startup working on solving marketplace problems. Read more about the platforms we're building [here](https://medium.com/gridwise-analytics) and [here](https://gridwise.io/features).
- âš¡ In graduate school, I was in a research group that studied and developed robust predictive modeling techniques for financial markets. To get an overview of the work, I recommend reading the published paper [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417417301331?via%3Dihub).
